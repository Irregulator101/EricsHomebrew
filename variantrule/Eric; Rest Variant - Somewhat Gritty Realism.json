						"This rest variant uses a short rest of four (4) hours and a long rest of two (2) days. A new \"breather\" rest can be taken for an opportunity to roll hit dice to recover hitpoints, but it does not confer the other benefits of a short rest such as spell slot replenishment. The length of a breather is determined by how many hit dice players wish to expend: 10 minutes per hit die.",
						"This approach may slow the pace of the campaign, reducing the number of encounters a party can engage in on a typical adventuring day from 6-8 to 3-4. Additionally, a short rest of four hours discourages attempting one in dangerous areas. Two day long rests encourage staying near civilization, or spending time to upgrade a campsite to a more defensible base of operations."
